                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Originally from a nice small town in upstate New York named <a href="https://sherburne.org/">Sherburne</a>. In 2005, a few 
                        years after I had earned a bachelor's degree in economics at Union college in Schenectady NY, I made the big decision with 
                        my Norwegian girlfriend to move to Norway and marry. We married in the southern part of Norway near Kristiansand, and have 
                        since been so lucky to have 2 children, both girls, who make their mother and father very proud. We now live in the rural 
                        town of <a href="https://vikersund.no/">Vikersund</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since living in Norway I have worked as a carpenter, day-care assistant, prison security guard, and for the past 13 years as a
                        school teacher.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once again I have with my wife's loving support made another major live changing decision, to pursue a career in programming, 
                        a career that has always intrigued me. In fact, if I could go all the way back to those early college days, where I was hanging
                        out with my many computer science buddies, I would defintely have changed my major and joined them.
                    <br>
                    <p>It seems that when it comes to me figuring out my career choice I am the epitome of a late bloomer. Nevertheless I know now and
                        for the first time ever truely look forward to working. 
                    </p>

                <h4>What Is Success</h4>
                <h5>--- by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h5>
                        <p>To laugh often and much;<br>

                        the affection of children;<br>
                        To earn the approbation of honest critics and endure<br>
                        the betrayal of false friends;<br>
                        To appreciate beauty;<br>
                        To find the best in others;<br>
                        To give of one's self;<br>
                        To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,<br>
                        a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;<br>
                        To have played and laughed with enthusiasm and<br>
                        sung with exultation;<br>
                        To know even one life has breathed easier because you<br>
                        have lived -<br>
                        This is to have succeeded.</p>
