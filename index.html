                <h2 class="about-me-title">About Me</h2>
                    <p>Originally from <a href="https://sherburne.org/">Sherburne</a> a small town in upstate New York, but in 2005 I made the big decision with 
                        my Norwegian girlfriend to move to Norway and marry. We married in the southern part of Norway near Kristiansand, and have 
                        since been so lucky to have 2 children, both girls, who make their mother and father very proud. We now live in the rural 
                        town of <a href="https://vikersund.no/">Vikersund</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since living in Norway I have worked as a carpenter, day-care assistant, prison security guard, and for the past 13 years as a
                        school teacher.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now, once again I have with my wife's loving support made another major live changing decision, to pursue a career in programming, 
                        a career that has always intrigued me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>It seems that when it comes to me figuring out my career choice I am the epitome of a late bloomer. Nevertheless I can finally say
                        that I am truely looking forward to getting to work.

                <h5 class="poem-author">--- by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h5>
                        <p class="poem-text">To laugh often and much;<br>
                        To win the respect of intelligent people and<br>
                        the affection of children;<br>
                        To earn the approbation of honest critics and endure<br>
                        the betrayal of false friends;<br>
                        To appreciate beauty;<br>
                        To find the best in others;<br>
                        To give of one's self;<br>
                        To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,<br>
                        a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;<br>
                        To have played and laughed with enthusiasm and<br>
                        sung with exultation;<br>
                        To know even one life has breathed easier because you<br>
                        have lived -<br>
                        This is to have succeeded.</p>
